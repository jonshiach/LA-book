## Vector equality

:::{prf:definition} Vector equality
:label: vector-equality-definition

Two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are said to be equal their corresponding elements are equal. In other words $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ where  $\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)^\mathrm{T}$ and $\mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n)^\mathrm{T}$ respectively, are equal if and only if the elements which correspond co-ordinate-wise are equal, i.e.,

$$ \begin{align*}
    a_i = b_i, \qquad i = 1, \ldots, n.
\end{align*} $$

Informally this happens if and only if they have the same magnitude and they point in the same direction.

It follows from the definition of vector equality that a vector can be moved parallel to itself and still represent the same vector, i.e., the position of the vector does not matter when considering vector equality. Consider {numref}`vector-equality-figure` which shows four vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ point in the same direction and have the same magnitude so we can say that $\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{b}$. The vector $\mathbf{c}$ has the same magnitude as $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ but points in the opposite direction so $\mathbf{c}\neq \mathbf{a}$. The vector $\mathbf{d}$ points in the same direction as $\mathbf{a}$ but has a larger magnitude so $\mathbf{d} \neq \mathbf{a}$.

Of these four vectors only $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are equal.

## Vector addition

Given three points with position vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ it is natural to ask how we might express the vector $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{ac}}$ in terms of $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{ab}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{bc}}.$ The answer is given by vector addition. In other words $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{ac}} = \overrightarrow{\mathbf{ab}} + \overrightarrow{\mathbf{bc}}$ where addition of two vectors is defined below.

:::{prf:definition} Addition of two vectors
:label: vector-addition-definition

The addition of two vectors $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is calculated using

$$ \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = 
    \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix} + 
    \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{pmatrix} =
    \begin{pmatrix} a_1 + b_1 \\ a_2 + b_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n + b_n \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$

Intuitively this makes sense, the displacement from $\mathbf{a}$ to $\mathbf{c}$ in any coordinate direction is just the displacement from $\mathbf{a}$ to $\mathbf{b}$ plus the displacement from $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{c}$ in the relevant coordinate direction.

The geometric representation of $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$ is represented in {numref}`vector-addition-figure`. Note that $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$ is the same as placing the tail of $\mathbf{b}$ at the head of $\mathbf{a}$. Note also, as the figure demonstrates, that the order in which one adds the two vectors is unimportant. This is known as the **parallelogram law of addition**.

## Scalar multiplication

:::{prf:definition} Scalar multiplication of a vector
:label: scalar-multiplication-of-a-vector-definition

The multiplication of a vector $\mathbf{a}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ by a scalar $k \in \mathbb{R}$ is defined by

$$ k \mathbf{a} = k\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} k a_1 \\ k a_2 \\ \vdots \\ k a_n \end{pmatrix}. $$
:::

Multiplying a vector by a scalar has the effect of **scaling** the vector $\mathbf{a}$ to produce a vector **parallel** to $\mathbf{a}$ with a magnitude of $k|\mathbf{a}|$. In general if two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are parallel then we write $\mathbf{u} \parallel \mathbf{v}$.

:::{prf:theorem} Properties of scalar multiplication of vectors
:label: properties-of-scalar-multiplication-of-vectors

The scalar multiplication of a vector $\mathbf{a}$ by a scalar $k$ has the following properties:

- $k\mathbf{a}$ = $\mathbf{a}k$  is a vector parallel to $\mathbf{a}$;
- $0\mathbf{a} = (0, 0, \ldots, 0) = \mathbf{0}$;
- $1\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{a}$;
- $|k\mathbf{a}| = |k||\mathbf{a}|$ ($|\mathbf{a}|$ is the length of the vector $\mathbf{a}$ - see {prf:ref}`vector magnitude<magnitude-definition>`);
- if $k>0$ then $\mathbf{a}$ and $k\mathbf{a}$ point in the same direction, whereas if $k<0$ then $\mathbf{a}$ and $k\mathbf{a}$ point in opposite directions.
